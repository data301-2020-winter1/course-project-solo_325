How Covid19 Has Affected Air Travel Around The World

## Milestones

Milestone I: Created Github repository as per course specifications.
             Selected dataset and had it approved by TA Amir. 
             Introduced and described dataset.
             Adding dataset to Github repository is in progress. File size is currently too large.
    Completed: October 23, 2020

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Using this data I want to quantify and show visually just how much of an impact the COVID19 outbreak has had on the airline industry. I would like to separate and analyze the flights by international, domestic and look at the change in volume of both cargo and passenger flights between this year and the last. This is of specific interest to me because I started a new job in the aviation industry just before the pandemic hit, and I have been following COVID19 and it’s impact on aviation quite closely this year. Specific ideas I currently have in mind include comparing the total flights per day and 7 day moving average between each day this year and the same day last year, looking at impacts on domestic vs international flights, comparing passenger and cargo aircraft flight volumes, and exploring if the pandemic had a greater impact on low-cost or high-end airlines. I can definitely see myself making a dashboard using this dataset. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset I am using for this project was retrieved today from zenodo.org. The data set consists of crowdsourced flight data collected from OpenSky Network, which is a non-profit  Swiss research organization founded to improve air travel. This dataset includes various metrics that track the what, where and when of both international and domestic flights. Those that are of most interest to me for the project include: the identifier that reveals which airline the flight is with, the aircraft model type, the departing airport name and time of departure as well as the arrival airport name and time of arrival. The data, presented as compressed csv.gz files, has been collected in one month intervals since January 2019. This allows me to compare flight metrics to those of equalivent time one year ago before the pandemic. The main purpose of this data is to illustrate how air travel was impacted by the COIVD19 pandemic and will be continually updated until the pandemic is declared over.
